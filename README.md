# Javi Rogue (Place holder title)
My best attempt at a real time action roguelike rpg for the GBA.<br>

## Planned Features
* Rogue like procedurally generated levels.
* Real time action combat.
* Item inventory for weapons, armor and consumables.
* Rpg story progression.
* "Recursive level progression."
